# Footprint
Climate change is a growing socio-environmental issue which impacts society globally. We believe in the quest towards climate resilience and reduction of carbon emission impact, the first step must be climate awareness. As such, we devised a tracker that would allow the common individual to track his carbon footprint. 
# Dairy
After logging in the mobile application, users can input data in the "diary" section. Using predetermined averages for carbon emmissions per mile and distance (which would vary based on transportation mode and model i.e cars and car model), we can then calculate the extent of the user's carbon footprint based on their transportation decisions and habits. 
# Records
This data is saved on a day to day basis, allowing users to get an average carbon footprint per a set period. The "records" section contains this data in a user friendly format (use of calender and a simple record history dashboard). 
# Map Features
The map feature uses the user's mobile phone's built in gps to track a users movement along a specifc route. Based on the users stated method of travel along specific routes, the speed of travel and the distance travelled, an estimated amount of carbon emission is generated.
